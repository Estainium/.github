What is the Trusted Supply Chain Exchange (TSX) Connector

Trustworthy supply chain exchange (TSX) is a method for exchange of certified product-level information (e.g., CO2 emissions or environmental, social and governance properties) in supply chains.
TSX addresses requirements on transparency, confidentiality and data control when sharing information across supply chain stakeholders. 
The key roles in TSX are Certifier, Supplier and Customer.

How does the Trusted Supply Chain Exchange (TSX) Connector work

Certifiers are already playing a key role in anchoring trust in complex supply chains.
Based on the knowledge of the supplierâ€™s production process and the carbon emission measurement method, a certifier can issue a PCF certificate to a supplier.
The supplier is the holder of the PCF certificate.
A supplier can then derive cryptographic evidence based on attributes from one or more PCF certificates and present it to a direct customer.
The customer as verifier can use the public digital keys of the certifier to check the correctness of the evidence presented.
Issuer, holder and verifier of PCF certificates appear in several stages in the TSX approach.A supplier is in the role of the holder of certificates relating to its own products. 
A supplier is also in the role of the verifier of the evidence presented by its own suppliers.
